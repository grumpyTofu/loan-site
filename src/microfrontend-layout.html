    This is the single-spa Layout Definition for your microfrontends.
    See https://single-spa.js.org/docs/layout-definition/ for more information.

  <!-- Example layouts you might find helpful:

  <nav>
    <application name="@org/navbar"></application>
  </nav>
  <route path="settings">
    <application name="@org/settings"></application>
  </route>

  -->
  <main>
    <!-- If I wanted this to only exist on defined pages would I need to move it into the route and repeat for all routes? -->
    <!-- Or could you do that in the root config file somehow? -->
    <!-- Ex. navbar shouldn't show on 404 page -->
    <nav>
      <application name="@built-labs/navbar"></application>
    </nav>
    <route path="loan-application">
      <application name="@built-labs/loan-application"></application>
    </route>
    <route path="success">
      <application name="@built-labs/success"></application>
    </route>
    <route default>
      <h1 style="padding: 3rem">404 Not Found</h1>
    </route>
    <redirect from="/" to="/loan-application"></redirect>
  </main>
